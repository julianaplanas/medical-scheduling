# iSchedule

We are iSchedule, a patient and doctor Appointment Scheduling Software.

Our page allows doctors to get new patients by sharing their profile to more people and using an easy way to manage their appointments. They can upload their availability each week, follow their appointments, cancel them if necessary and make prescriptions for their patients, all in one page.

Also, patients have access to multiple doctors, making it more quickly and easy to keep their medical controls up to date. Being healthy has never been so effortless. Patients can make appointments with doctors, follow their schedule, cancel appointments if necessary and keep a record of the prescriptions doctor sent them.
